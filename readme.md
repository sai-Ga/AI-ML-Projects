# AI/ML Projects

Welcome to my collection of AI and Machine Learning projects! This repository showcases a wide range of projects that I’ve implemented, covering various aspects of data science, machine learning, and AI. The projects range from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to working with popular libraries and frameworks like Hugging Face, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and more.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   In these projects, I dive deep into datasets to uncover insights through visualization and statistical analysis. The focus is on understanding data patterns, distributions, and relationships using libraries like:
   - **Pandas** for data manipulation.
   - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
   - **NumPy** for efficient numerical computations.

   Example techniques used include:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Handling missing values.
   - Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends.
   - Summary statistics and feature engineering.

### 2. **Hugging Face Projects**
   These projects utilize Hugging Face’s `transformers` library to work on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as:
   - Text classification.
   - Text summarization.
   - Sentiment analysis.
   - Fine-tuning pre-trained models for custom tasks.

   Models like BERT, GPT, and T5 are leveraged to solve real-world NLP problems. I also explore dataset loading and evaluation using `datasets` and `evaluate` libraries.

### 3. **Machine Learning Projects**
   These projects cover implementations of machine learning models using Python libraries such as:
   - **Scikit-learn** for classical machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
   - **PyTorch** for building deep learning models including neural networks, convolutional networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
   - **TensorFlow** for training and deploying models in various use cases like image classification and regression tasks.

   Each project contains model training, evaluation, and tuning processes, along with insights gained from the model performance.

### 4. **Data Manipulation and Processing**
   Projects here are focused on working with structured and unstructured data, utilizing powerful tools such as:
   - **Pandas** for dataframes and complex data operations.
   - **NumPy** for working with arrays and mathematical operations.
   - **Dask** for scaling Pandas operations for large datasets.

### 5. **Visualization Projects**
   Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding data. Projects in this section focus on creating rich, informative visualizations using:
   - **Matplotlib** for 2D plots and graphs.
   - **Seaborn** for statistical data visualization.
   - **Plotly** for interactive visualizations.

### 6. **Deep Learning Projects**
   - Leveraging **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** to build deep learning architectures like CNNs and RNNs.
   - Applying transfer learning on pre-trained models for image classification tasks.
   - Exploring neural networks for sequence data, sentiment analysis, and language models.
